# GeoStitch
Georeferenced Drone Footage Video to Stitched Image â†’ Superimposed on Map

## Objective
The objective of this project is to process georeferenced video footage, which simulates drone imagery, and convert it into a geospatially aligned, stitched image suitable for training AI models in applications such as remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and geographic analysis.
